# Big Computer Manager

Big Computer Manager, also known as BCM, is an enterprise level download manager. With this software, a corporate IT department can easily control and configure mass downloads and software updates on hundreds or even thousands of employee laptops and desktops.

The business is based around product support and configuration. We will be able to help users install, configure, and maintain BCM for a monthly fee.

We decided on using the MIT license as it is very useful for commercial use. It's a short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices.
